Week 2 Lecture 1: Linear Regression Regression in X and Y Firstly for regression Y is continious X \( \rightarrow \) Y
Single Regression: X consists of only 1 feature Find fucntion given arbitrary X, that can predict Y with minimum error In Linear Regression this output Y function happens to be a line, trained based on an existing set of (X,Y) Multiple Regression: Multiple features in X Linear Regression Simple Linear Regression: \( Y = \theta _0 + \theta _ 1 X \) Obviously, \( \theta _0 \) is the Y axis intercept, while \( \theta _ 1 \) is the population slope.

Week 1 Lecture 5: Tutorial 1 Agenda Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning Different types of Features: Categorical vs Contiious Features Supervised Learning Regression vs Classification Bias vs Varience Generalisation Performance of A Learning Algorithm Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning Basic algorithms to follow Suppose we have a huge number of images (1 Million, say)
Clustering Done -> Get a broad idea about what are the different kinds of images Classifier is run for each of these clusters to discover intricacies in this data So step 1 is unsupervised, while step 2 may be supervised or unsupervised.

Week 1 Lecture 4: Evaluation and Cross Validation Given a hypothesis space H and training data S, the learning algo comes up with a function h. To understand how good the h is, we need to evaluate it using experimental evaluation, ie having a metric using which we evaluate, eg
error metric accuracy precision and recall These evaluations are done on the training set or even better a seperate test set.

Week1 Lecture 3: Hypothesis Space and Inductive Bias Inductive Learing or Prediction Given examples or data of form (x , y) or (x, f(x)) Classification Problems: f(x) is discrete Regression Problems: f(x) is continuous Probability Estimation: f(x) is the probability of x Why inductive learning: Given data, use induction, as opposed to deduction, to try and identify a function that predicts the data.
Features: Properties that describe each instance

Week 1 Lecture 2: Different Types of Learning Supervised Learning Has (X, Y) given as data, where X was input, Y was output, and model tries to find out Y for a new X and compare with the given Y Give a label to X (ie find Y) UnSupervised Learning Only X is given Given X, Cluster or Summarise them, ie organise them into meaningful groups Reinforcement Learning Given an &ldquo;agent&rdquo; Determine what to do based on rewards and punishments Agent takes an action which impacts the enviornment, based on which it is rewarded ( rewards can be [-1, 0, 1]) The agent tries to optimise longterm rewards SemiSupervised Learning //Not defined in Andrew Ng&rsquo;s course, who put it in supervised learning only Combo Given labelled training data, and a even larger unlabelled data, come up with algo to process the unlabelled data Most common for now Supervised Learning We have a set of input features given \( X_1, X_2, &mldr; , X_n \), with respect to which the instances are described.

Introduction Definition of Learning: The ability to improve behaviour or a prediction based on experience.
Building comp sys that improve with experience
Machine Learning Explores algorithms learn from data and build models from data Models can be used for some tasks, eg prediction, decision making or solving Formal definition of ML (Mitchell): A computer program (machine) is said to learn from experience E, with respect to some class of tasks T, and performance measure P, if its performance on task T as measured by P improves with experience E.

First of , for credits I am extremely thankful to my friend Soham for guiding me, and laying the groundwork of LaTeX rendering. He built this page using the tutorial found here at DZHG And using the Hyde theme from here
