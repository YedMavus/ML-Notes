# Week 1 Lecture 5: Tutorial 1
## Agenda
* Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
* Different types of Features: Categorical vs Contiious Features
* Supervised Learning
  * Regression vs Classification
* Bias vs Varience  
* Generalisation Performance of A Learning Algorithm


## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Basic algorithms to follow
Suppose we have a huge number of images (1 Million, say)
1. Clustering Done -> Get a broad idea about what are the different kinds of images
2. Classifier is run for each of these clusters to discover intricacies in this data 


So step 1 is unsupervised, while step 2 may be supervised or unsupervised.

## Categorical vs Continious
