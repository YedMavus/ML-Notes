# Recommender Systems

1. Item Recomendation
2. Rating Prediction

## Defn: 
We have a set of users **U** and a set of items **S**

**P** is a function from 

\\(  P : U \bigcross S \rightarrow  **R** \\)

So we learn P from data, and based on P we predict the utility value of each item to each user.

- Content based RS:
  - Rating prediction  based on content of current and previous item (like in YouTube)
- Collaborative or Content Based RS
  - For a user find similar users [based on past data] and if those similar users have given a rating of an item, predict that [kind of like Knn]
- Item Based [Alternative to Collaborative]
