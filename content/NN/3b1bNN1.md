# But What is a Neural Network

### Here we take example of handwriting recognition to detect Numbers

Couple of layers
Each layer contains nodes that take care of a part of the number. So each of these functions sort fo drives or pushes the output towards on enumber, which on adding up end up predicting one particular number at the end.
