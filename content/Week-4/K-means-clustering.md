# K-means-clustering

A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.

K-Means clustering is used to clump unsupervised data into K different subgroups / clusters, in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. 

The K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible. K-**means** clustering is called so, cause it finds the mean (ie trhe centroid).

## K means algorithm:

### Classify Clusters

### Move older centroid to new centroid of Data Points

### Stopping iterations:
- The centroids have stabilized â€” there is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful.
- The defined number of iterations has been achieved.
