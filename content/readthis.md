First of , for credits
I am extremely thankful to my friend [Soham](https://github.com/teito-dev) for guiding me, and laying the groundwork of LaTeX rendering. He built this page using the tutorial found [here](https://dzhg.dev/posts/2020/08/how-to-add-latex-support-in-hugo/) at DZHG
And using the Hyde theme from [here](https://github.com/spf13/hyde)
