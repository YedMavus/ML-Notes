First of , for credits
I've built this page using the tutorial found [here](https://dzhg.dev/posts/2020/08/how-to-add-latex-support-in-hugo/) at DZHG
And using the Hyde theme from [here](https://github.com/spf13/hyde)


Now here's how to do it. Just fork my github repo, 
go to content/ folder and make a new note using whatevername as 
a .md file , dont worry you'll be able to use latex inside it 


Like this 

$$\sum_{x=1}^5 y^z$$

and this

\\[\int_a^b f(x)\\]


;)

aight that was all.
Let me know if you get stuck
