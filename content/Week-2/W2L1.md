# Week 2 Lecture 2: Linear Regression

## Regression in X and Y

### Firstly for **regression** Y is continious

X \\( \rightarrow \\) Y

* Single Regression: X consists of only 1 feature
  * Find fucntion given arbitrary X, that can predict Y with minimum error
  * In **Linear Regression** this output Y function happens to be a line, trained based on an existing set of (X,Y)
* Multiple Regression: Multiple features in **X**

## Linear Regression

#### \\( Y = \beta _0 + \beta _ 1 X \\)
