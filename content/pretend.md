# Pretend You're Happy
## Jay Foreman


Bloody hell, bloody hell the world is awful
Well there's killing and starvation
And injustice and religion everywhere
Everything, everything is looking dreary
There's too many people in the world
And far too much pollution in the air
Everything I used to love has turned to shit
All the world's gone bankrupt now and it
Doesn't look like things can soon improve
I'm noticeably older than I was
Definitely fatter, just because
I no longer feel the need to move


Well, what do you do when the world around you makes you so depressed?
What do you do when you've lost the motivation to get dressed?


Pretend that you are happy
And smile when you're feeling blue
If you pretend you're happy
You'll start to believe it's true
It's better to fake a smile
Than fill the world with woe
So just pretend you're happy
And nobody will know


Bloody hell, bloody hell the world is scary
Cos there's nothing but corruption and destruction and reality TV
Every day, every day I slowly realise
Every single thing I used to know
And trust is run by people just like me!
One at a time I'm losing touch with my
Former friends and lately it seems I
Never ring the contacts in my phone
Every time I breathe, it could be my last breath
And I'm getting closer to my death
For which I will probably be alone


Well, what do you do when you've lost all the ambitions you once had?
What do you do when the slightest inconvenience makes you sad?


Pretend that you are happy
And smile when you're feeling down
If your friends think you're happy
They'll still want you around.
You'll realise it's important
To be glad with what you've got
So just pretend you're happy
And keep quiet if you're not
Pretend that you are happy
And smile when you're feeling blue
If you pretend you're happy
You'll start to believe it's true
It's better to fake a smile
Than fill the world with woe
So just pretend you're happy
And nobody will know
