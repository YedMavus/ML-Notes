## Feature Reduction For K-Nearest Neighbours

More features reduce accuracy. More info != more discriminative power!

This is because, some features are irrelevant, and introduce noise, and fool the algorithm (especially a lazy algo like Knn)
Moreover they may have redundant features, as we have limited computational resources.
